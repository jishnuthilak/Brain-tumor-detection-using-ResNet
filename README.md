Introduction
Brain tumor detection is a critical task in medical diagnosis. This project leverages deep learning and computer vision techniques to accurately identify the presence of tumors in brain MRI images. The project utilizes the Resnet-18 model for classification and Grad-CAM for visual explanations of the predictions.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of brain MRI images labeled with the presence or absence of tumors. [Provide details about the dataset source, preprocessing steps, and any augmentation techniques used.]

Model
Architecture
The model architecture is based on Resnet-18, a powerful convolutional neural network commonly used for image classification tasks.

Training
The model was trained using [specify the framework used, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch] on the brain MRI dataset. Training parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs can be found in the notebook.

Grad-CAM
Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) is used to visualize the regions of the brain MRI that the model focuses on when making predictions. This helps in understanding and interpreting the model's decisions.

Results
[Provide details about the model's performance, including accuracy, loss, and any other relevant metrics. Include visual examples of Grad-CAM results.]
