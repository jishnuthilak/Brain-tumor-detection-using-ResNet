Brain tumor detection is a critical task in medical diagnosis. This project leverages deep learning and computer vision techniques to accurately identify the presence of tumors in brain MRI images. The project utilizes the Resnet-18 model for classification and Grad-CAM for visual explanations of the predictions.
